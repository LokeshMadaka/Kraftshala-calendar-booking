# **Kraftshala Calendar Booking Backend Service**

    This project is a backend calendar booking service built as part of the Kraftshala – Intern, Backend Developer assignment.

    The service allows users to create accounts and schedule meetings, while ensuring that no two meetings overlap in time.
